% With our agents, we need to define their interactions and how those 
% interactions change their properties. We need to check the distance 
% between our agents and if they are close to an infected agent. 
% If an uninfected agent is close to an infected one we will 
% let the disease transfer and change the uninfected agents status to infected.
% We iterate this process as our agents move around --> simulation.
